# twitch-chat-intergration
allows you to add twitch commands to your game

get the token here https://twitchapps.com/tmi (make sure not to forget this link)
if your username is the same as your channel name keep them the same in the inspector as well

known issue:
sometimes if theres to many commands at once you need to get another token (just go back to the link and hit generate again)
